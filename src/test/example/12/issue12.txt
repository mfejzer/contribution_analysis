Hello, I just wanted to let you know that I made some minor modifications to the SQLReader routine to support reading from SQLite data sources.  The configuration is similar to that used with MySQL, except the database name is instead a path to the sqlite file, and username, password, etc. are not required.  I've tested the new functionality and it seems to work fine in my own limited applications.I also added a few lines of code at the end of the SQLReader function to perform database connection cleanup, as recommended in the DBI documentation.I would like to thank you for this package.  I have been using it for a few weeks now, and it has been a real time saver.  I very much like the organization it enforces.  Please keep up the great work!-- Patrick
