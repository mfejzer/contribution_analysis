i've tried runExample() and runApp() with KDE's browsers konqueror (rendering with KHTML) and rekonq (webkit), version 4.10.2. apps are only partly shown (no results are produced, conditional panels are ignored), while everything works fine in firefox.however, when i installed shiny-server and started the same apps through it, they ran fine in all browsers. so apparently it's not really an issue on the browser side, but probably in the way runApp() deploys apps?i tried with the CRAN version of shiny as well as a recent git snapshot.
