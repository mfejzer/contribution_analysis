In thinking through the `stopApp()` use cases, I'm thinking it might be nice to be able to be able to programmaticly pass values from a previous step in the workflow into the Shiny app. This could be as elegant or manual as we wanted it to be initially (convert all values passed in to global options, pass them in as a parameter into UI.R, or even dynamically set the defaults behind-the-scenes using these values.Note that passing this parameter into older versions of shiny would fail as an unrecognized parameter. I'm still thinking it would make sense to accept `...` in `runApp` to allow us to fail more gracefully on some of these new features we'll add later, rather than crashing outright.
