Dear shiny team,thanks very much for this excellent package.I have a question regarding using 'other-than-English' languages. I used an html page created by markdownToHTML to report data containing Spanish names with accents. The markdownToTHML function creates the HTML package marked up with UTF-8 and it correctly displays in a browser. However, when I use that same page to show up as htmlOutput in a shiny tab filled on the server side with readLines("pagename.html") it shows garbled text. Same, if I use the original table with renderTable.Where could I set a switch or something to get the content right?Thanks and best regards,Reinhard
