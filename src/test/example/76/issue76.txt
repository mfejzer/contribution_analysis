I'm playing with a little app design that has something like this:    numericInput("id", "ID:", 10000000000),Unfortunately, that default displays as `1e+10`. The function should probably have some sort of formatting or number-type argument that disables scientific notation, potentially disables the decimal point for integers, etc.Related, it'd be useful to be able to disable the stepping part of that widget, in cases where it's not relevant (ID numbers, phone numbers, etc.)An alternative to this would be a filter to `textInput` that could be used to restrict input to a certain regular expression or similar.
