I have some date like this which from 61 to 124 at interval 7. I would like to show them in the sliderInput. But the first value is 63 (9 * 7) when I use the following codes.     x <- c(61,  68 , 75,  82, 89,  96, 103, 110, 117, 124 )    sliderInput('x',  'X:', 					min = min(x),					max = max(x), 					value = min(x),					step = 7,					animate = TRUE)I looked the source codes of Shiny. It seems Shiny directly pass step parameter to JQuery. Are there any ways to show my values with sliderInput or other side bars?Thanks in advance.
