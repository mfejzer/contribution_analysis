Absolutely loving Shiny.  Great job.  I did notice one issue in my testing.  If I'm working off a remote RStudio server (or, theoretically, a remote R server although I've yet to do this), and I go to run an app with runApp(), a browser pops up attempting to connect to localhost:8100 rather than rstudio_server_url:8100.  The relevant code is this line:appUrl <- paste("http://localhost:", port, sep = "")Is there any way that the URL of the server instance (as retrieved from the browser) can be used instead of localhost, if running in an rstudio server?
