Hi John,There's a bug in the inst/defaults/lib/utilities.R file in that the clean.variable.name function generates syntactically invalid names if a file's name consists of only numbers, e.g '2006.csv'. This version uses the R function <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/make.names.html">make.names()</a> from the base package to generate the correct variable names, which is what R uses internally to clean data.frame names, etc. It will produce names like X2006.I think itâ€™d be worthwhile to pull it into the project. Thanks for making such a great package!
