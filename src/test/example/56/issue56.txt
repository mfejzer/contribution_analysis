Hello,I'm currently developping a small R/Shiny application where the different inputs and outputs are separated by tabs, within a wizard.This implies that the output tabs are hidden by default when the page is loaded (because of ```display: none;``` in the Bootstrap ```.tab-pane``` class).But according to this thread https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/pull/97, hidden outputs are suspended. I tried to apply the solution given by wch by adding the following code to my server:```outputOptions(output, "piePlot", suspendWhenHidden=FALSE)```where ```piePlot``` is the plot which is hidden by default.When I launch the application and generate the graphics, the following message appears in place of the plot:    Error in if (width <= 0 || height <= 0) return(NULL) :     Missing value where TRUE/FALSE is required.I don't know if that is relevant, but I use a form with an input[type="submit"] in order to trigger the plot generation.In advance, thank you for your help.
