I am having an impossible time installing 'shiny' in RStudio in my macbook, which has the latest RStudio for mac version installed. The error message I receive is below. Can anyone advise on this issue? Install.packages("shiny") returns the following:Warning in install.packages :  package ‘shiny’ is not available (for R version 2.13.1) Installing package(s) into  ‘/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/library’ (as ‘lib’ is unspecified)Warning in install.packages :  package ‘shiny’ is not available (for R version 2.13.1)
