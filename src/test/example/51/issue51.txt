This is more a suggestion than an issue. I apologize if this is not where I should be posting it.When starting from some selected range of values on the slider, there does not appear to be a possibility of anchoring the lower boundary (or upper) when using animate = T or animate = [insert list of animationOptions] so that the animation may proceed by increasing the selected range instead of just shifting it.For instance, unveiling a time series plot (using a fixed maximum xlim and ylim of course) as opposed to only being able to view a moving window of the series. This would be a nice feature if possible.
