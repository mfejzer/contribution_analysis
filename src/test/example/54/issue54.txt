When a shiny app is loaded for the *first* time, the outputs are displayed only when all the outputs are calculated.For instance,``` output$field1 <- renderPrint({     longProcess1() }) output$field2 <- renderPrint({     longProcess2()        })```field1 is displayed only when longProcess1 (of course) **and** longProcess2 is ended.After the first time, the app behaviour is magic (as described in the docs): if there are not dependencies between the fields, when field1 is modified only longProcess1() is called. :)Any suggestion?As workaround how to understand if the client is waiting a response?Just to display the usual message, for instance, "loading...".
