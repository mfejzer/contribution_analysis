I've got an app where I'm displaying the same data different ways on different tags. Below the output graphs, I've got this trivial item:```rh3(textOutput("n"))```defined by:```r  output$n <- reactiveText(function() {    paste("n =", nrow(this_dat()))  })```Works great if I have a single tab. If I have two tabs, each of which have the above (but with different `plotOutput` objects), then the Javascript crashes because of the duplicate object names.The workaround is to duplicate the above with `n2`. Not a big deal, once I figured out the problem, but it'd be great if there were some way to have the same output objects on multiple tabs without error. At a minimum, a better error message would be very helpful.Thanks!
