It would be useful if shiny had a `runDemo` function like this:```RrunDemo <- function(package, demo, ...) {  path <- system.file("demo", demo, package = package)  if (path == "") stop("Couldn't find demo ", demo, " in ", package, call. = FALSE)  runApp(path, ...)}```then you could easily run demos in installed packages:```RrunDemo("apps/basic", "gigvis")```That might almost be a better way to implement `runExample()`:```RrunExample <- function(example, ...) runApp("shiny", example, ...)```although then you'd have to move the existing examples into the demo directory - this would be a good idea because it's fits the R package conventions a little better, and reduces the confusion between `runExample()` and `example()`
