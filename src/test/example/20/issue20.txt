I'm trying to use runUrl() with a .zip file with the following structure:```./app./app/server.R./app/ui.R```I get the following error:```Error in setwd(appDir) : cannot change working directory```I've traced the problem back to the following lines:```dirname <- as.character(unzip(filePath, list = TRUE)$Name[1])unzip(filePath, exdir = dirname(filePath))...appdir <- file.path(dirname(filePath), dirname)```The output from `unzip(filePath, list = TRUE)` is:```          Name Length                Date1 app/server.R   2874 2013-08-26 13:36:002     app/ui.R   2562 2013-08-26 13:09:00```so as a result, the .zip file is being extracted to `dirname(filePath)`, but `appdir` is being set to a directory called `app/server.R` within `dirname(filePath)` which doesn't exist.A possible fix could be:```appdir <- file.path(dirname(filePath), dirname(dirname))```Session Info:```R version 3.0.1 (2013-05-16)Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)locale:[1] LC_COLLATE=English_United States.1252  LC_CTYPE=English_United States.1252    LC_MONETARY=English_United States.1252 LC_NUMERIC=C                          [5] LC_TIME=English_United States.1252```
