This is on along the same lines of #222. Right now we're using RJSONIO, which isn't very fast. rjson seems to be faster. For example:```> data(diamonds, package="ggplot2")> system.time(d <- RJSONIO::toJSON(diamonds))   user  system elapsed   0.995   0.018   1.013 > system.time(d <- rjson::toJSON(diamonds))   user  system elapsed   0.319   0.004   0.322 ```rjson uses C, but I have a feeling that it should be possible to get even faster with a custom C implementation.If we make this switch, we'll have to be careful that the new toJSON function has the same result (e.g. rounding of numbers).
