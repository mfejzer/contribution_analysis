it does not seem to worth a dependency; I guess it takes you five minutes to port an existing C routine to do base5 encoding (e.g. http://base64.sourceforge.net/b64.c, or see the orphaned package http://cran.r-project.org/package=base64)I have an R version here: https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/R/utils-base64.R
