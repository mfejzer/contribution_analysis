I've made three changes in this fork:1) I added an XLS reader using gdata, which I believe to be the most cross-platform compatible solution to this. I've tested on OS X and Ubuntu, I don't have access to Windows to test at the moment.2) I expanded the capabilities of URLReader to allow any other supported file format. It accomplishes this by directly importing those formats that are supported (anything using read.csv, read.xls, and load), or by saving a temporary file to tempdir(). In this, the separator argument in .url YAML files is no longer required - the separator is parsed from the filename.3) In doing this, I noticed that the SPSS and Stata readers weren't actually hooked up to load. I added them to the extensions.dispatch.table.Feel free to incorporate any or all of these changes. Great package - use it all the time!Noah
