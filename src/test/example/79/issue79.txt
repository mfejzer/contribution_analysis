`singleton` and `tags$head` are designed to execute while the page is rendering for the first time and don't currently work in reactiveUI mode. Would need to put explicit support within reactiveUI to fix tags$head, where reactiveUI output that resulted in stuff being written to the head could be pushed there. And for singleton, maybe calculate a hash for each singleton and make that part of the HTML of the page somehow. The init call back to the server could include a list of all singleton hashes that have been calculated so far, this could be stored in shinyapp.
