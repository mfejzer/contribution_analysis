It would be very helpful to throw more informative error messages when there are extra commas in calls to functions that generate tags. This is something that happens a lot when I've written Shiny UI code.For example:```div(div(), )# Error in tag("div", list(...)) : argument is missing, with no default```Hadley wrote some code that gives much more helpful messages: https://gist.github.com/hadley/6309295It gives a message like this:```f(1, b, 3, )# Error: Extra comma at position 4 in call to f() ```
