Trying to use in the same ui a submitButton and a fileInput, it seems that when a file selection is done, the submitButton is not taken into account, that is to say, the output are processed immediatly.Even if it could be taken as a bug, I think it should be more convenient to have an explicit event handling method for the submitButtton.Something like a boolean which says if the last event was the press on this button (false if it was any other widget which was updated) ... But I don't know if it is possible with the shiny events policy...It should also allow to use several buttons on the same ui.Best regards,Yann
